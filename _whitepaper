A quick description of how JKM works

- Two modes: one that processes a directory content, and one that monitors a directory for new content
- Content to be prosessed is detected on the basis of a file name
- Once a content file has been detenced, the main look calls a Sample object constructor (type depends on the INI file)
- A sample can (and mostly should) contain one of more SampleImage objects
- Then, the main look checks for various postprocessing options as listed in the INI file
- Postprocessing is typically handled by calling a function of the Sample object (in the style of sample.getbarcodes)
- If needed, the Sample object will then look at its list of SampleImages and call their methods for extracting data from the images
- Actual processing algorithms are in separate files like jkm/barcodes.py. These typically take a image (opencv/PIL image) + 
  algorithm parameters as params.

- A custom logging classes handles logging. ALl subpacgakes should have a 'log' variable, which the main script does set.
- Sample class subclasses (etc.) should have their own _toJSON_ functions for serialization.
