INSTALLING
-----------
Install tesseract. On Helsinki University computers, this needs HelpDesk support (unless you have admin access)

Install some Python packages, if you do not have them already

pip3 install jsonpickle
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install watchdog
pip3 install pytesseract
pip3 install pyzbar
pip3 install openpyxl

USING AN UPDATING CSV FILE AS A DATA SOURCE IN EXCEL
----------------------------------------------------
Excel files are in principle editable only by one program at a time. We can get around this limitation by having one file open normally in Excel, another one as a read-only updating data source, and pulling data from the latter into the former via VLOOKUP. This is a bit untrivial :/
